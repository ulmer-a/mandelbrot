## Cross platform Mandelbrot fractal Renderer (OpenGL)

### Building

Build the project using `CMake`. To be able to run the application as
a standalone binary, all the support library sources are compiled into
static libraries and shipped with the program.

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ ./mandelbrot
```
